# Project_Euler
 Submissions to Project Euler challenges in Jupyter Notebooks

In an effort to improve my abilities in mathematics I began attempting [Project Euler challenges](https://projecteuler.net/)<br>

My goal was to have the results compute as close to within 1 second as possible, but no longer than 5 seconds.  If a challenge took an especially long time, it was my indication to research ways to improve efficiency and improve my understanding of more difficult mathematical concepts.
